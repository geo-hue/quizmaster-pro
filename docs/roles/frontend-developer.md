# Frontend Developer Role Document for QuizMaster Pro

## Role Overview
The Frontend Developer is responsible for creating an engaging and intuitive user interface for the QuizMaster Pro application. This role focuses on implementing the visual aspects of the application using React, ensuring that users can seamlessly interact with the quiz functionalities. The Frontend Developer will work closely with the Backend Developer to integrate APIs and deliver a cohesive user experience across various devices.

## Key Responsibilities
### 1. Design and Implement User Interface Components
- **Description**: Develop reusable React components that reflect the design specifications and enhance user interaction.
- **Example**: Create a `QuizCard` component that displays quiz details such as title, description, and a start button. This component should be styled to fit within the overall application theme.

### 2. Ensure Responsive Design Across Different Devices
- **Description**: Utilize CSS and responsive design techniques to ensure the application is accessible and functional on various screen sizes.
- **Example**: Implement media queries in CSS to adjust layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop views, ensuring that the quiz interface is user-friendly on all devices.

### 3. Integrate the Frontend with Backend APIs
- **Description**: Collaborate with the Backend Developer to consume RESTful APIs for quiz functionalities such as user authentication, quiz creation, and participation.
- **Example**: Use the Fetch API or Axios to retrieve quiz data from the backend and display it in the application. For instance, fetching the leaderboard data and rendering it in a `Leaderboard` component.

## Technical Requirements
- **React**: Proficiency in building single-page applications using React, including hooks and state management.
- **JavaScript**: Strong understanding of ES6+ features, asynchronous programming, and DOM manipulation.
- **CSS/Responsive Design**: Experience with CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind) and techniques for creating responsive layouts.
- **API Integration**: Familiarity with RESTful services and how to handle JSON data.

## Deliverables
- Fully functional user interface components for the application, including:
  - User authentication forms (sign-up/login)
  - Quiz creation and management interface
  - Real-time quiz participation UI
  - Leaderboard display
- Documentation of component usage and API integration.
- Style guides or design documentation for consistency across the application.

## Integration Points
- **With Backend Developer**: Regular communication to understand API endpoints, data structures, and authentication mechanisms. Ensure that the frontend can handle the responses from the backend effectively.
- **With UI/UX Designers**: Collaborate to ensure that the implemented designs meet user experience standards and are visually appealing.

## Development Workflow
- **Branching Strategy**: Use Git for version control. Follow a feature branching strategy where each new feature or bug fix is developed in its own branch.
- **Code Review Process**: Implement peer code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members. Use pull requests to facilitate discussions on code changes.
- **Testing Approach**: Write unit tests for React components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.

## Technical Decisions
- Choose state management solutions (e.g., Context API, Redux) based on the complexity of the application and the need for global state management.
- Decide on the CSS methodology (e.g., BEM, CSS Modules) to maintain a scalable and maintainable styling approach.
- Determine the approach for handling asynchronous data fetching (e.g., using hooks like `useEffect` for API calls).
